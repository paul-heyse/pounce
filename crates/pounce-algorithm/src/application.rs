//! User-facing application object — port of `Interfaces/IpIpoptApplication.{hpp,cpp}`.
//!
//! # Crate placement
//!
//! `IpoptApplication` lives in `pounce-algorithm` (rather than
//! alongside the other Interfaces-side ports in `pounce-nlp`) because
//! `optimize_tnlp` needs to drive the full IPM: it constructs a
//! `TNLPAdapter` + `OrigIpoptNlp` (from `pounce-nlp`) and hands the
//! NLP off to an [`IpoptAlgorithm`] (this crate). `pounce-nlp` cannot
//! depend on `pounce-algorithm` (the reverse already exists), so
//! orchestration must live on the algorithm side. Public callers
//! continue to import via `pounce_algorithm::IpoptApplication`.
//!
//! `optimize_tnlp` routes every problem — constrained or not —
//! through the same primal-dual IPM, exactly as upstream Ipopt does:
//! it builds the algorithm via [`crate::alg_builder::AlgorithmBuilder`]
//! (default backend MA57 from `pounce-hsl`) and runs
//! [`IpoptAlgorithm::optimize`].

/// **The dominance ratio alone is not the whole test, and reading it as
/// one is how a `dual_inf` of `0.44` opened a retry.** The ratio says the

///    buys back.
/// 2. **An objective *improvement* may not be bought with primal slack.**
///    Two costs this carries, named rather than hidden (R3). It is an exact
///    non-increase with **no noise floor**, so it fires the same on
///    `2.07e-25 -> 1.09e-09` (where the move is the whole defect) as on
///    `1e-17 -> 1.1e-17` (where which side a retry lands on is arithmetic):
///    of the 45 promotions this PR removes, ~35 are improvements refused
///    because the violation ticked up somewhere far below any tolerance. The
///    direction is conservative — the base answer is feasible and in hand —
///    but "refuses purchases, not improvements" is only true above the noise.
///    And the rule detects *the primal moved*, not *below the optimum*: had
///    `scholtes4`'s retry **held** its violation, `f = -6.6088e-05` would have
///    been admitted, which the second assertion of
///    `an_improvement_bought_with_primal_slack_is_refused` states outright.
///    On that model the two coincided.
///    The remedy is for a *dual* defect — the premise is that the primal
///    has settled — so a retry that lands further outside the constraints
///    *and* reports a better objective has not repaired the runaway, it
///    has moved somewhere the model does not reach. This is what
///    `scholtes4` does: from a base at `f = +1.82e-09` with a constraint
///    violation of `2.07e-25` it promotes `f = -6.61e-05` at `1.09e-09`,
///    below the model's exactly-known `f* = 0`, and reports
///    `Optimal Solution Found`.
///
/// Both comparisons are skipped when the base attempt is not itself
/// feasible within [`IpoptApplication::dual_divergence_retry_accept_tol`]:
/// there is then no admissible point to protect, and the retry's is
/// strictly better information.
///
/// `tol` is that same acceptable tolerance, scaled by
/// `max(1, |base_obj|)` so the comparison is relative on a large
/// objective and absolute on a small one — the convention
/// `sigma_forward_error_is_small` uses for `‖x‖` and for the same reason.
/// It is not a fitted constant: the objective moves this has to admit
/// (`qpec_small`, `5.8e-11`) and the ones it has to refuse (`r201`,
/// `0.198`; `scholtes4`, `6.6e-05`) sit four and five orders away from it

///
/// `sense` is `+1` for a minimization and `-1` for a maximization, and both

/// [`SolveStatistics::final_objective`] is the objective evaluated on the

/// and a negative `obj_scaling_factor` is the documented way to pose a

/// repo has shipped one defect from this sign already —
/// `masked_certificate_fuzz.rs::the_veto_is_not_disabled_by_a_negative_objective_scaling_factor`,

        // one that is.

        // It is not free either. On `square_flowsheet_resto`'s lbfgs leg the

        // 3000-iteration budget, and ends no better than the first -- after
        // which rung 4 of the second-opinion ladder converges the model in 178
        // with the escalation off. That is 6178 real iterations to reach an
        // answer that 3178 reach without the flip, and the flip contributes
        // nothing to it. Measured both ways: `mu_strategy=adaptive` alone

        // spend it on.
