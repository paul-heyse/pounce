/// is what made the race cheaper; adding `Amf` was the regression.
///
/// The current pair was measured as both correct and the fastest of the
/// three sets, over four real KKT patterns costed as first-`factor()`

///    pins Schur nodes to their etree-index positions. The Schur subset
///    forms a top-forest of the etree (parent always strictly greater

///    column numbering and would break the tail invariant. The Schur
///    path forces `preprocess == None` and `amalgamation_strategy ==
///    Adjacency` regardless of what the caller passed in
///    `snode_params`.

/// Empty `schur_indices` ⇒ returns the same result as
