//! Hungarian algorithm for the minimum-cost perfect bipartite
//! matching problem.
//!
//! The core kernel for MC64-style scaling. Given a sparse
//! non-negative cost matrix in CSC form, finds a perfect matching
//! (row-to-column) minimizing total cost, and returns both the
//! matching permutation and the optimal dual variables from the
//! LP dual. Those duals are what get exponentiated into the
//! row/column scalings in `mc64.rs`.
//!
//! Reference: citet:duff2001mc64 §4. Source model:
//! `ref/spral/src/scaling.f90::hungarian_match` (lines 938-1171),
//! itself a clean-room rewrite of HSL_MC80. The algorithm is the
//! standard shortest-augmenting-path variant — each augmenting
//! path is a Dijkstra-like search on the reduced-cost graph, and
//! the dual variables are updated to preserve complementary
//! slackness.
//!
//! PHASE 2.2.1 STATUS: real implementation (Step 3). Follows SPRAL's
//! `hungarian_match` / `hungarian_init_heurisitic` line-by-line, with
//! Rust-idiomatic naming and a custom index-based binary min-heap
//! that supports decrease-key (mirroring SPRAL's `q`/`d`/`l` arrays).
//! The custom heap is used instead of `std::collections::BinaryHeap`
//! because BinaryHeap lacks decrease-key, and lazy deletion would
//! require wrapping `f64` distances in a tie-breakable ordered type —
//! mirroring SPRAL's index-based heap produces cleaner code.
