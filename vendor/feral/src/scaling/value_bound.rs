//! Value-bounded validity check for reusing a cached MC64 scaling
//! across warm `Solver::factor` replays (Track B2).
//!
//! An IPM driver calls `Solver::factor` repeatedly on a
//! bit-identical sparsity pattern with drifting values. The MC64
//! Hungarian matching that produces the scaling vector is dominated
//! by the *pattern*, not the values (see
//! `dev/research/mc64-value-bounded-cache-2026-05-17.md`), so the
//! scaling vector `D₀` computed on iter 0 is usually still good for
//! iter N. "Still good" means: applying `D₀` to the current matrix
//! `A_N` keeps it diagonally dominant enough that Bunch-Kaufman
//! pivoting selects pivots — and hence computes inertia — the same
//! way fresh scaling `D_N` would.
//!
//! This module provides the O(nnz) check that decides reuse-vs-
//! recompute. It does **not** rerun the Hungarian. Plan:
//! `dev/plans/mc64-value-bounded-cache.md`.
//!
//! ## Qualifying rows (Deviation 1 from the research note)
//!
//! The research note assumed a fully-populated diagonal. A KKT with
//! a structurally-zero `(2,2)` block has rows with a zero diagonal
//! and nonzero off-diagonals; their dominance ratio is `+∞`, which
//! would neuter the growth-factor and growth-count conditions. The
//! check therefore aggregates only over **qualifying rows** — rows
//! whose diagonal entry is structurally present and nonzero in the
//! cache-baseline matrix. `rocket_12800` (the B2 target) has a
//! fully-populated, all-nonzero diagonal, so every row qualifies and
//! there is no behaviour change on the target.
