//! Partitioned quasi-Newton Hessian — a **per-constraint element**
//! updater (Griewank & Toint partitioned updating; Asprion, Chinellato &
//! Guzzella, *J. Appl. Math.* 2014, doi:10.1155/2014/341716, applied it to
//! direct-collocation trajectory optimization).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! [`crate::hess::lim_mem_quasi_newton::LimMemQuasiNewtonUpdater`]
//! approximates the whole Lagrangian Hessian with `m` curvature pairs and
//! publishes it as a [`pounce_linalg::low_rank_update_sym_matrix::LowRankUpdateSymMatrix`],
//! which [`crate::kkt::low_rank_aug_system_solver::LowRankAugSystemSolver`]
//! applies by Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury. Two consequences:
//!
//! * the `(1,1)` block the sparse factorization sees is **diagonal**, so
//!   whatever block structure the model's Hessian has is invisible to the
//!   linear solver's ordering — and the Schur path
//!   ([`crate::kkt::SchurAugSystemSolver`]) is bypassed entirely
//!   (`alg_builder.rs`, the `is_lbfgs` branch);
//! * `m` pairs cannot represent the curvature of a 60 000-variable
//!   collocation model, and the iteration count shows it.
//!
//! This updater takes the other route. The Lagrangian is a sum of
//! *element functions* with small support,
//!
//! ```text
//!     L(x, y) = f(x) + Σ_j (y_c)_j c_j(x) + Σ_j (y_d)_j d_j(x)
//! ```
//!
//! so its Hessian is the assembly of the elements' own Hessians:
//!
//! ```text
//!     ∇²L = ∇²f + Σ_j (y_c)_j ∇²c_j + Σ_j (y_d)_j ∇²d_j
//! ```
//!
//! We keep one small dense symmetric `B_e` per element, update each from
//! that element's **own** curvature pair, and scatter-add the weighted
//! blocks into a [`SymTMatrix`] — the same type the exact-Hessian path
//! publishes, so the whole downstream KKT machinery is unchanged and the
//! factorization sees the true block-banded pattern.
//!
//! # Why per-constraint, and not per-primal-block
//!
//! Asprion et al. partition the *Lagrangian* by primal stage blocks.
//! That is fewer, larger elements, but each element's target moves as the
//! multipliers move. Splitting per constraint row instead gives each
//! `B_e` a **multiplier-independent** target — `∇²c_j` is a property of
//! the model, not of the iterate — so the approximation converges instead
//! of chasing `y`. It also needs no new user-facing structure hook: an
//! element's support is a row of the constraint Jacobian, whose pattern
//! every TNLP already declares.
//!
//! # Why SR1 is the default here
//!
//! An individual constraint is not convex, so `sᵀy > 0` fails routinely
//! and Powell-damped BFGS would force each `∇²c_j` model positive
//! semidefinite — then multiply it by a multiplier of either sign. SR1
//! carries the sign, and the indefiniteness reaches the IPM's inertia
//! check, which is exactly what
//! `dev-notes/issue-131-monotone-lbfgs-stall.md` records the damped path
//! hiding. [`UpdateType::Bfgs`] is accepted for comparison.
//!
//! # Bounded element size
//!
//! An element with `k` nonzeros costs `k(k+1)/2` stored reals. A row that
//! touches most of `x` — a global resource constraint, or an objective
//! that sums over every stage — would blow that up, so elements wider
//! than `max_element` degrade to a **diagonal** approximation
//! (Dennis-Wolkowicz weak secant, `sᵀBs = sᵀy`) rather than being
//! dropped: a separable objective is then still represented exactly, and
//! a coupled one is represented approximately instead of not at all.
