//! Unsymmetric LU factorization family for simplex basis factorization
//! (issue #81).
//!
//! This is a **separate** factorization family from feral's symmetric LDLᵀ
//! solver. An LU basis is unsymmetric and square, factored as `P B Q = L U`
//! with threshold partial pivoting (row permutation `P`) and, on the sparse
//! path, a fill-reducing column permutation `Q`. There is no inertia.
//!
//! The design target is a revised-simplex basis engine: cheap rank-1
//! column-replacement updates and warm `ftran` (`B⁻¹a`) / `btran` (`B⁻ᵀa`)
//! solves, not just one-shot factor/solve. See `dev/research/unsymmetric-lu.md`
//! and `dev/plans/unsymmetric-lu-epic.md`.
