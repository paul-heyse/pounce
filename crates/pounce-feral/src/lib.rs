//! FERAL backend — pure-Rust sparse symmetric LDL^T factor.
//!
//! Implements [`SparseSymLinearSolverInterface`] over [`feral::Solver`].
//! The lifecycle mirrors `pounce_hsl::Ma57SolverInterface`:
//!
//! * `matrix_format()` returns [`EMatrixFormat::TripletFormat`] (1-based,
//!   lower-triangle COO) so the IPM `TSymLinearSolver` wrapper requires
//!   no changes versus the MA57 path.
//! * `initialize_structure` caches the 0-based row/col arrays needed by
//!   FERAL's [`CscMatrix::from_triplets`] and allocates the values
//!   buffer.
//! * `multi_solve` refreshes the `CscMatrix` from the cached pattern +
//!   caller-filled values and dispatches to [`feral::Solver::factor`] /
//!   [`feral::Solver::solve_many`]. The CSC is built once per pattern; later
//!   factorizations scatter the new values through a cached triplet → slot
//!   permutation instead of re-running `from_triplets` (gh#562). FERAL's
//!   pattern-fingerprint cache likewise reuses the symbolic factorization
//!   across iterates with identical structure (the IPM common case).
//! * `increase_quality` delegates to [`feral::Solver::increase_quality`]
//!   and uses MA57's `pivtol_changed` / `CallAgain` protocol so the
//!   upper-layer reload-and-retry semantics line up.
