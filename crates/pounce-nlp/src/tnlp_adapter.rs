//! TNLP → IpoptNLP adapter — Phase-3-scope port of
//! `Interfaces/IpTNLPAdapter.{hpp,cpp}`.
//!
//! Splits a user-facing [`TNLP`] (mixed bounds, mixed equality /
//! inequality constraints) into the separated form
//!     min  f(x)
//!     s.t. c(x) = 0    (equality)
//!          d(x) - s = 0,  d_L ≤ s ≤ d_U   (inequality with slacks)
//!          x_L ≤ x ≤ x_U
//! used by the algorithm. This file ships only the **classification**
//! piece — bounds and constraints are sorted into eq/ineq/{lower,upper}
//! sets and the corresponding index maps are computed. The full adapter
//! (function-evaluation routing, sparsity propagation, fixed-variable
//! treatment, scaling) lands with Phase 5 when `IpoptNLP` and
//! `ExpansionMatrix` are wired up.

/// So presence is decided first, and *directionally* — a lower bound is absent
